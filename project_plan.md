# AI Travel Itinerary Planner – Software Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

Build an AI-powered itinerary planner that enables users to create, refine, and manage day-by-day vacation schedules through an interactive chat interface. The system uses AI to generate itineraries based on user input and allows ongoing refinements. Authentication and itinerary management features are required. Mobile responsiveness and bonus features (image sourcing, booking links, developer’s own feature) are optional.

## 1.1. Dependency Inventory

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js, React, or Vue
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js/Express, Flask, or Next.js API routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth, Clerk, or custom (bcrypt, JWT, etc.)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API or similar
- **Image API (optional):** Unsplash, Pexels
- **Booking/Tour APIs (optional):** Viator, GetYourGuide, Booking.com, Airbnb
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, PostHog, or similar (for user behavior and performance)
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, or similar
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Vercel/Netlify CI, or similar
- **Other:** dotenv (env management), ESLint/Prettier (linting/formatting), security libraries (helmet, cors, etc.)

## 2. SDLC Phases & Strategy

### 2.1. Requirements Analysis
- Review and clarify all functional and technical requirements (see `project_guidelines.md`).
- Identify user personas and main use cases (e.g., travelers planning trips, returning users refining itineraries).
- Define MVP scope (core features: authentication, itinerary creation, chat interface, itinerary management) and optional/bonus features (image sourcing, booking links, developer’s own feature).
- Document acceptance criteria for each feature, referencing the examples in `project_guidelines.md`.

### 2.2. System Design
- **Architecture:**
  - Choose a monorepo (e.g., Next.js full-stack) or split frontend/backend (e.g., React or Vue frontend + Node.js/Express or Flask backend).
  - Define API contracts and data models (User, Itinerary, Message, etc.).
  - Select a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) to store user and itinerary data.
  - Plan authentication (Supabase Auth, Clerk, or custom logic with hashing, sessions, JWTs, etc.).
  - Design AI integration (OpenAI API or similar) for itinerary generation and updates.
  - Plan analytics integration for user behavior and performance monitoring.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Desktop-first responsive design; mobile responsiveness as a bonus.
  - Chat interface: user messages on one side, AI replies on the other, with distinct bubble styles and timestamps.
  - Initial form or modal to collect trip dates, destination, and preferences; persistent input at the bottom for follow-up messages.
  - Itinerary display: group day-by-day activities under clear headings (e.g., “Day 2 – July 2”).
  - Itinerary list page: grid or list showing title, dates, thumbnail, and quick actions (view, rename, delete).
  - (Optional) Display images and booking/hotel links beneath associated activities.
- **Security:**
  - User data isolation, secure authentication, and authorization.
  - Input validation and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

### 2.3. Implementation
- **Setup:**
  - Initialize repository and project structure.
  - Configure environment variables and secrets management.
- **Backend:**
  - Implement authentication and user management (registration, login, session management).
  - Create itinerary CRUD APIs and chat history storage, ensuring itineraries are scoped to the authenticated user.
  - Integrate AI service for itinerary generation and updates, passing full chat history for context-aware responses.
  - (Optional) Integrate public image APIs (Unsplash, Pexels) and booking/tour APIs (Viator, GetYourGuide, Booking.com, Airbnb).
- **Frontend:**
  - Build authentication flows (register, login, logout).
  - Implement chat interface and itinerary display as described in the guidelines.
  - Create itinerary list and detail pages.
  - Add forms/modals for trip input.
  - (Optional) Render images and booking/hotel links inline under activities.
  - Integrate analytics to track user behavior (e.g., page views, itinerary creation, feature usage) and performance (e.g., load times, errors).
- **Testing:**
  - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical flows (authentication, itinerary creation, chat, etc.).
  - Manual UI/UX testing for usability and responsiveness.
  - Test authorization to ensure users cannot access others’ itineraries.

### 2.4. Deployment
- Select hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, etc.).
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Configure environment variables and secrets in production.
- Deploy database and connect to backend.
- Monitor deployment and resolve issues.
- Monitor analytics dashboards for user behavior and performance insights.

### 2.5. Maintenance & Iteration
- Monitor logs, errors, analytics, and user feedback.
- Fix bugs and optimize performance.
- Plan and implement bonus features or improvements (image sourcing, booking links, developer’s own feature).
- Regularly update dependencies and address security issues.
- Use analytics data to inform UX improvements and feature prioritization.

## 4. Risk Management
- **AI API limits/costs:** Monitor usage and set quotas; handle API errors gracefully.
- **Authentication bugs:** Use proven providers or thoroughly test custom logic; ensure secure password handling.
- **Data loss:** Regular database backups and disaster recovery plan.
- **Scope creep:** Stick to MVP for initial release; schedule bonus features separately.
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit code and dependencies; follow best practices for web security.
- **Analytics privacy:** Ensure analytics tools are configured to respect user privacy and comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR).
